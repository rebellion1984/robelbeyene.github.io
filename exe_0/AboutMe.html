   <p>I am highly motivated, determined and progressive individual who strives to achieve a high standard of work ethics in whichever role is undertaken.
   I have a strong academic   background and the analytical ability to think through a problem coupled with the confidence to achieve high performance 
   for the organisation. The world of computers has become one of the fastest growing technologies, which requires experts in all fields from software 
   programming to computer hardware, and influences so many of your daily activities. This has led me to consider a career in Computer Science giving 
   me a desire to discover, further, how the computers work. Whilst studying Computer Science at Kingston University, I really enjoyed the challenge,  
   particularly programming in various languages which allowed me to constantly be creative and learn new things such as creating simple programs for  
   own use or to solve a problem. The post graduate degree that I have done at Kingston University was critical at furthering my practical and        
   theoretical knowledge in the field of Software Engineering and it also has proven my dedication to the IT world and the ability of working independently. </p>
